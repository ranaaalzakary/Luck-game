# Luck-game
C program to play luck game with the user Using pointers in C.

The program begins by adding 10 integer random numbers from [1-10] to an array. Set a pointer where the array cells are by using it. The user should then be prompted by the program to select an index of any array cell. The program generates a second random variable value (1 or 0) toÂ indicate pointer direction (forward or backward). The random value inside the cell that is selected in accordance with the generated direction updates the pointer position (forward or backward). The value is then retrieved from the memory location that the pointer pointed to in the program. If the pointer is pointing at a cell within the array, the user is lucky; otherwise, they are unlucky.
